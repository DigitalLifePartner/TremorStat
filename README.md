# TremorStat

The application allows users to detect the level of tremor in their hand. The application uses gryroscope data to read such movement and a graph to display the data to the user.

## Requirements

### Instructions

Upon cloning the project a user MUST include the Eureka submodule through the use of a git command line prompt. Open terminal; navigate to the directory of the TremorStat project (using cd); enter the command (git submodule add https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka.git), and check that the submodule was installed correctly. The final step is to change the Deployment Target of the Eurkea.xcodeproj file to the device's iOS version.

Upon correctly installing the project an individual may Run (âŒ˜R) the code through an emulator or through a device. If done through a device, a user must: plug in their device using to the computer; sign in with their Apple account through Xcode->Preferences->Accounts; have a unique bundle ID; select Device; trust the user upon installation (Settings->General->Profiles & Device Management).
